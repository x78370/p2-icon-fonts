Why:
  Make an icon font to cut back on load times. There are plenty of uses and reasons to use icon fonts: https://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/. Change the icons all at once, their size, color, manipulate just like a text. 



How: 
  Start with a vector program such as Illustrator. The tricky part is making sure all of the icons you create in vector have the same weight/feel. (Tip: create a square box as a guide and create all of the icons within the same size box.) Creating one icon to the same width as another, but having one shorter than the other is going to create an odd feeling between the icons. They don't appreciate being next to each other knowing one of them looks like an outcast/reject. 

  Keep consistency throughout. If you start detailed, keep the rest detailed. If you are looking for a thicker stroke throughout, continue that to all of the icons. Thought is likely needed to rethink a few icons that you are looking to make. 

  Once all of the icons are finished, cut them all to size with their own artboards making them fill out their entire artboard (this is easy to do if you kept them all contained within the same size square box). http://youtu.be/CbzTjamoDyM This video can help you get the artboards done quickly and file saving portion.

  Save them as *.svg files, then upload to a place like www.fontastic.me. From there it's easy to just follow their instructions the rest of the way.



Results: 
  I already mentioned in the how the corrections that I need to make to my car icon font pack. Some have lines with too thin of stroke widths. Some I tried to put too much detail into them. The icons I was going for should have been cut down to something much more simple. Keep posted and they will be improved. http://trenthp.github.io/p2-icon-fonts/
